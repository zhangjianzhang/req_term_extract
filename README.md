## Repository Introduction

In this repository, we provide illustrative codes of three unsupervised requirements terminology extraction methods introduced in the *Chapter 3 - Terminology Extraction* of *Natural Language Processing for Requirements Engineering* book. These codes can be run in on-line coding environments, e.g., Kaggle and Google Colab. 

For training supervised requirements terminology extraction models, it is necessary to have sufficient annotation data. For the implementations of the CRF and Bi-LSTM-CRF algorithms, we recommend <a href="https://taku910.github.io/crfpp/" target="_blank">the CRF++ tool</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/advanced_tutorial.html" target="_blank">the tutorial provided by PyTorch</a>.
